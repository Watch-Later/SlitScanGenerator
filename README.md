## Usage:

1. Open Video file ![img](https://github.com/jkriege2/SlitScanGenerator/blob/master/SlitScanGenerator/icons/folder_video.png) (It will be scaled down and only every N'th frame will be loaded to save memory during the initial stage)

2. click on the top-left image and select positions for cuts. If you like a cut, add it with the ![add](https://github.com/jkriege2/SlitScanGenerator/blob/master/SlitScanGenerator/icons/list_add.png) "add ..." buttons. All selected cuts will be shown in the list on the bottom right

3. Finally click on ![img](https://github.com/jkriege2/SlitScanGenerator/blob/master/SlitScanGenerator/icons/wizard2.png) "Process All" to generate the output images (in the same folder as the video). Note that Ã¼rpcessing is done with the full resolution video, not the size-reduced video used for display.
